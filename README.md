# SQL World Database Project

This project is an analysis of the Create and World Databases using MySQL, demonstrating my SQL skills and data analysis abilities.

## Project Overview

The World Database is a comprehensive dataset that provides information about countries, cities, and continents. 
The Create Database is a dataset focusing on information surrounding invoicing, inventory and stores.
In this project, I used MySQL to query the data and extract meaningful insights from it. 
I will highlight the project's key components, the insights gained, and the MySQL skills demonstrated.

## SQL Skills Demonstrated

Throughout this project, I showcased the following SQL skills:

- **Data Manipulation**: Employed various SQL commands to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data.

- **Joins**: Utilized SQL joins to combine data from multiple tables for comprehensive analysis.

- **Aggregation**: Employed aggregation functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG to summarize data.

- **Subqueries**: Utilized subqueries to retrieve data based on complex conditions.

## Insights Gained

The analysis of the World and the Create Databases yielded several insights, such as:

- **Lowest Populated Cities** : Identified and ranked the cities with the lowest populations.

- **Continental Insights**: Analyzed data by country/city to find population, life expectancy, and GDP information.

- **Languages Spoken**: Investigated the most commonly spoken languages in the Caribbean region.

- **Custom Analysis**: Performed custom analysis, such as finding countries with the highest life expectancy and cities that begin with 'F' around the world.

- **Calculating Discounts/Prices**: Added a discount factor and created a new price column to tables.

- **Generating EER Diagrams**: Observed the relationships between tables and took note of primary and foreign keys

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the two database files 'world db' and 'create-databases' and the remaining sql file 'sqlPART2'

2. Open the 'create-databases' file and the word document 'SQLAssignmentDAYA'.
   After skimming through the Create dataset, have look at my analysis and the EER diagrams for both databases

4. Repeat with the World dataset and the sql analysis file

5. Have fun exploring!

## Project Dependencies

- Microsoft Word (screenshots of analysis and EER diagrams)
- MySQL (for querying and databases)

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my MySQL skills and data analysis abilities by importing the World and Create Databases, and extracting meaningful insights from it. By showcasing the SQL skills listed above and providing valuable insights, I have not only honed my SQL skills but also showcased my data analysis capabilities and potential.
