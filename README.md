#SQL World Database Project

This project is an analysis of the World Database using MySQL, demonstrating my SQL skills and data analysis abilities.

##Project Overview

The World Database is a comprehensive dataset that provides information about countries, cities, and continents. 
The Create Database is a dataset focusing on information surrounding invoicing, inventory and stores.
In this project, I used MySQL query the data and extract meaningful insights from it. 
I will highlight the project's key components, the insights gained, and the MySQL skills demonstrated.

##SQL Skills Demonstrated

Throughout this project, I showcased the following SQL skills:

    Data Manipulation: Employed various SQL commands to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data.

    Joins: Utilized SQL joins to combine data from multiple tables for comprehensive analysis.

    Aggregation: Employed aggregation functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG to summarize data.

    Subqueries: Utilized subqueries to retrieve data based on complex conditions.

##Insights Gained

The analysis of the World and the Create Databases yielded several insights, such as:

    Lowest Populated Cities: Identified and ranked the cities with the lowest populations.

    Continental Insights: Analyzed data by country/city to find population, life expectancy, and GDP information.

    Languages Spoken: Investigated the most commonly spoken languages in the Caribbean region.

    Custom Analysis: Performed custom analysis, such as finding countries with the highest life expectancy and cities that begin with 'F' around the world.

    Calculating Discounts/Prices: Added a discount factor and created a new price column to tables.

    Generating EER Diagrams: Observed the relationships between tables and took note of primary and foreign keys
